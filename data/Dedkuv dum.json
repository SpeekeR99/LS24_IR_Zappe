        "Dědkův dům is found in the northeast part of the Bažiny, just off the Stará cesta. It is a modest dwelling on its own little island, which it shares with an outbuilding of some sort. This is where Dědek can be found, once he has been safely escorted on his pilgrimage to the Shrine of Melitele.\n\nÚkoly\nTajemná věž\nRostliny\nFeainnewedd\nKvět dvouzubce\nBílá myrta"
