        "Druidové are scholars of the forest, and their understanding of nature's workings is deep. They take in wild animals and help them heal of wounds and sickness, they also take in most anything injured or orphaned. Druidský hájek, grown around the Strom života, is a sanctuary where no blood is spilled.\n\nVýznamní druidové\nVisenna\nFregenal\nMyšilov\nKruhy a posvátná místa\nCaed Myrkvid\nBleobheris\nCaed Dhu, kruh z Angren\nKruh z Koviru\nKruh blízko Mayeny\nLoc Monduirn\nZe hry Zaklínač\n\nDruidové jsou k nalezení v Druidském hájku in the Bažiny, just north of the Lesní mýtina in Kapitoly II and III. In Kapitola V, some of them have fled to the Hřbitov v bažinách, where Zelený pochod preparations appear to be in full force in the Druidská jeskyně.\n\nDruidové are caring individuals and have no wish to see anyone or anything suffer. A nice side benefit of this philosophy is that anyone in their immediate vicinity who needs it receives free healing.\n\nStarší druid\n\nStarší druid is alone among the druids willing to sell and buy things. He is a source of knowledge and the one Geralt is supposed to speak with, mostly, but not exclusively.\n\nHierofant\n\nHierofant is a professional dice player who has a liking for Lysohlávka. He can be found in the druids' grove in the Bažiny during Kapitola III.\n\nPoustevník\n\nPoustevník is also a druid and professional dice player but he's more interested in serving the Lady of the Lake. He can be found in the pole during Kapitola IV.\n\nZelený pochod\n\nZelený pochod is a peaceful attempt by the druids and like-minded people to draw attention to the preservation of nature.\n\n "
