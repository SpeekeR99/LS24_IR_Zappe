        "Not to be confused with his place of business, this is Malcolm Stein, or the Dům trpasličího kováře. It is located in \"Malý Mahakam\", the Čtvrť nelidí of the Chrámová čtvrť. It faces both Kalkstein's and Golan Vivaldi's houses, but is separated from them by a low wall. The only access is from an alley off Peddler Street, just north of Lebedův lazaret. It also happens to be the single richest source of Vlčí aloe in the entire game. The potted wolf's aloe there grows eight leaves at a time.\n\nThis is where the půlelfa that was being held by the thugs in the slums during the Strašidelný dům quest is staying and where she asks Geralt to meet her to claim his reward.\n\nÚkoly\nStrašidelný dům"
