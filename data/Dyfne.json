        "Dyfne or Dyphne – Řeka about three days' walk from the border which divides Aedirn a Kaedwen. The river originates in Modré hory and flows westward through Dol Blathanna until it ultimately joins the Pontar. Guleta is located south of the Dyfne.\n\nIt was on a bridge over the Dyfne that Margreve Mansfeld of Ard Carraigh and marshal Menno Coehoorn embraced and shook hands, according to Marigold."
