        "==Absolute beginners?==\nIf you can type and click, you can edit most pages on this wiki.\n#Find a page to improve. (If you want, you can practice in the Sandbox first. It's there for \"practicing\", or experimenting with almost anything. It's a good place to get used to how the wiki works.)\n#Click \"Edit this page\".\n#An \"edit box\" will open - type your new sentences or corrections (just like MS or Lotus or WordPerfect wordprocessing)\n#Click the \"Save\" button - (well, it may be wise to hit the \"Preview\" button first, in case of mistakes!)\n#You're now a Web Publisher. Welcome to the team!\n\n==More detail==\nAs with all wikis, you can edit any non-protected page on this wiki. Your changes will be visible immediately. Just click the \"edit\" link that appears near the top of every page to begin.\n* Do explain your edit in the \"Summary\" box between the edit window and the save and preview buttons. eg: \"typo\" or \"added info on xyz\".\n* Use the \"Show preview\" button to check your edit and get the formatting right before saving. Remember to Save page before moving on or your changes will be lost.\n* If you are logged in, you can mark an edit as minor by checking the This is a minor edit box to let people know your edit is not something substantive.\n\nTo try editing, open a new window and go to the Sandbox (which is an editing test area), and then click the \"edit\" link. Add anything you would like to test out and click save.\n\n==Formatting==\nMost text formatting is usually done with wiki markup, so you don't have to learn HTML.\n\n===Boldface and italics===\nBold and italics are added by surrounding a word or phrase with multiple apostrophes ('):\n\n''italics'' is rendered as italics. (2 apostrophes on each side)\n:*'''bold''' is rendered as bold. (3 apostrophes on each side)\n:*'''''bolded italics''''' is rendered as bolded italics. (2 + 3 = 5 apostrophes on each side)\n\n===Headings and subheadings===\nHeadings and subheadings are an easy way to improve the organization of an article. If you can see two or more distinct topics being discussed, you can break up your article by inserting a heading for each section.\n\nHeadings can be created like this:\n:*== Main heading == (2 equals signs)\n:*=== Subheading === (3 equals signs)\n:*==== Another level down ==== (4 equals signs)\n:*===== Another level down ===== (5 equals signs)\n\nIf an article has at least three headings, a table of contents (TOC) will be automatically generated. Try creating some headings in the Sandbox and see the effect on the TOC.\n\n===Indenting===\nTo indent text, place a colon (:) right at the beginning of a line. The more colons you put, the further indented the text will be. A newline (pressing Enter or Return) marks the end of the indented paragraph.\n\nFor example:\n\nThis is aligned all the way to the left.\n::This is indented slightly.\n:::This is indented more.\n\nis shown as:\n\nThis is aligned all the way to the left.\n:This is indented slightly.\n::This is indented more.\n\n===Bullet points===\nTo insert a bullet, use an asterisk (*). Similar to rectal indentation, more asterisks in front of a paragraph means more indentation.\n\nA brief example:\n\n* First list item\n:* Second list item\n:** Sub-list item under second\n:* Isn't this fun?\n\nWhich is shown as:\n:*First list item\n:*Second list item\n:**Sub-list item under second\n:*Isn't this fun?\n\n===Numbered lists===\nYou can also create numbered lists. For this, use the number sign or hash symbol (#). Using more #s will affect the level of indenting.\n\nExample:\n\n#First item\n:#Second item\n:##Sub-item under second item\n:#Third item\n\nDisplays as:\n:#First item\n:#Second item\n:##Sub-item under second item\n:#Third item\n\n==Links==\nLinks are important in wikis because they help readers navigate your site.\n\n===Internal links===\nYou can extensively cross-reference wiki pages using internal links. You can add links to existing titles, and also to titles you think ought to exist in future.\n\nTo make a link to another page on the same wiki, just put the title in double square brackets. For example, if you want to make a link to, say, the Main page, it would be:\n\n[[Witcher Wiki|Main Page]]\n\nIf you want to use words other than the article title as the text of the link, you can add an alternative name by adding it after a pipe \"|\" divider (SHIFT + BACKSLASH on English-layout and other keyboards). For example, if you wanted to make a link to the Main Page, but wanted it to say \"home page\" you would write it as such:\n\nView the [[Witcher Wiki|home page]]...\n\nIt would appear as:\n:View the home page...\n\nWhen you want to use the plural of an article title (or add any other suffix) for your link, you can add the extra letters directly outside the double square brackets. For example, you would write:\n\nThis is an article about [[monster]]s.\n\nIt would appear as:\n\nThis is an article about monsters. (the link will be red if this page does not yet exist)\n\n===Interwiki links===\nTo link to another Wikia, you can use its title followed by a colon and the article name, instead of using the full URL. For example, the Creatures Wiki home page is at Creatures:Creatures Wiki Homepage, which can be typed as\n\n[[Creatures:Creatures Wiki Homepage]]\nrather than as\nhttp://creatures.wikia.com/wiki/Creatures_Wiki_Homepage\n\nThis style of link works for any wiki in the interwiki map, not just for Wikia. See the Central Wikia page at Wikia:Help:Interwiki link.\n\n===External links===\nIf you want to link to a site outside of Wikia, you may just type the full URL for the page you want to link to. So to have a link like this: http://www.google.com/ , just type this:\n\nhttp://www.google.com/\n\nIt is often more useful to make the link display something other than the URL, so use a single square bracket at each end, with the alternative title after the full URL address, separated by a space (not a pipe). So if you want the link to appear as Google search engine, just type:\n\n[http://www.google.com/ Google search engine]\n\n===Redirects===\nTo redirect automatically from one page to another, type #REDIRECT and then put in brackets the name of the page to be redirected to. For example, you could redirect from \"Cats\" to \"Cat\". That way, anyone typing either version in the search box will automatically go to \"Cat\". In this wiki, we talk about currency in the game, so a natural redirection would be from \"Money\" to \"Oren\" and it would look like this:\n\n==Wiki variables and templates==\nUse {{SITENAME}} to see the current Wikia. For instance, {{SITENAME}} on this site prints out as Zaklínač Wiki.\n\nThat and a few other templates are common to MediaWiki sites.\n\nCheck the current list of all templates on this Wikia.\n\nYou can create templates. After you create the page Template:XXX, using the command {{XXX}} will include that content in your current page. So, if you have something that needs to be included on many other pages, you might want to use a template.\n\nMost templates available on the Central Wikia can be used on individual wikia with just \"wikia:\" prefixed to the name. See the help page on Central at Wikia:Help:Shared templates."
