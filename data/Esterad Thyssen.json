        "Esterad Thyssen\nInformace\nTituly\nV období druhé války:\nKrál Koviru\nKrál Povissu\nKrál Naroku\nKrál Velhadu\nKrál Talgaru\nVztahy\nRodiče\nBaldwin Thyssen (otec)\n\nBlanka z Malleore (matka)\n\nReálný svět\nVýskyt\nSága o Zaklínači\nEsterad Thyssen byl králem Koviru, Povissu, Naroku, Velhadu a Talgaru v období druhé války s Nilfgaardem. Jeho rodiče byli Baldwin a Blanka z Malleore. Byl svalnatý a vysoké postavy, také dobře vypadal - ve svých šestapadesáti letech vypadal stěží na pětačtyřicet. Esterad (a před ním i jeho otec) žili v období velmi složitém jak pro Kovir, tak i pro dynastii Thyssenidů.\n\nNutno přeložit...\n\nThe first of several bloody power struggles occurred with the secession of Poviss, when king Rhyd declared himself autonomous. He gained independence as did the East March (which later split into several duchies and kingdoms, only to finally unite as the so-called \"Hengfors League\"). But the worst was yet to come - there was a revolt and Baldwin lost control of his crown to Idi, and for the first time in the history of the house, the Thyssens were forced to flee. During the escape of King Baldwin died suddenly, probably due to brain aneurysm.\n\nBecause of this, Esterad spent most of his youth in exile in Talgar.\n\nBut he did not bide his time unproductively. Esterad considered various plans, gathered his strength, gained adherents, including forging secret pacts and alliances. Finally, he struck back and decisively. One night, known ever since as the \"Night of knives and torches\", Idi, Rhyd and their entire families were killed. The Thyssen dynasty was restored.\n\nAlthough Kovir was officially neutral, Esterad helped the Northern forces, by granting royal pardon to the prisoners in his kingdom, many of which later formed the Free Company led by \"Adieu\" Pangratt.\n\nHe met his future wife and queen, Zuleyka, while in exile. Their children (in birth order) are: Gaudemunda, andHeloiza and Tankred.\n\nHe was killed on the stairs of his own palace by assassins, choosing to stay and protect Zuleyka instead of fleeing."
