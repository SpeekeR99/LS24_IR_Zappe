This lab is guarded by two thugs and requires a password (or some other form of persuasion) for entry.\n\nHe and his thugs are found at the southernmost accessible part of the sewers (where they tunnels form a \"Y\"). He also holds the Šifrovací klíč Salamandry, which is necessary to decipher zašifrovaný dokument recovered as part the Diplomacie a lov quest.\n\nÚkoly\nDiplomacie a lov\nPo nitce až ke klubíčku\nWyzimská spojka"
