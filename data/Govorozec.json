        "Error: soubor není platný nebo neexistuje\n\nGoworożec (meaning roughly \"his horn\") is a village situated in Ebbing just north of the Pereplut swamp. Its name is derived from a stone shrine in which there was a sacred statue of jednorožec. It was originally made of gold, later replaced by a silver statue, which was replaced by copper, then bone and finally out of successively less valuable sorts of wood. However, every jednorožec statue was stolen until the decision was taken to make them out of straw.\n\nNeratin Ceka died here trying to help Ciri escape the clutches of Leo Bonhart, Rience and Stefan Skellen.\n\nDůležitá místa\nShrine"
