        "Gwendeith je pevnost v Modrých horách obývaná Svobodnými Elfy. It is where elves who did not want to take part in the senseless killing retreated. They called themselves the \"Elfové z Modré hory\"). The fortress itself was located at the top of the mountain, overlooking three valleys rising from successive terraces in the Blue Mountains. The suns rays reflecting off the white peaks give the impression that the whole mountain on which the fortress was built is aflame.\n\nFree Elves reside in the valley below.\n\nPoznámky\nNázev ve starší mluvě znamená: Bílý Plamen."
