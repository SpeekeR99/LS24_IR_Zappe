        "Hildegarda Zollstock is a widow living in the Chrámová čtvrť. Her husband died roughly a month before the game begins. She can be found walking on the Graveyard Alley, or standing outside brána hřbitov around noon. It seems that her now deceased counterpart is not happy merely enjoying the great beyond. He is intent on spreading malicious lies about the poor woman. What's a widow to do?\n\nÚkoly\nNeklidný duch"
