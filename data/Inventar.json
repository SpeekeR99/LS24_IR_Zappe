        "\t\n\nInventář is quite different from most RPG orientated games. Because it doesn't allow you to store any zbraně, zbroje or other overly large random items. Instead, it revolves around the fact that you carry a satchel in which you can merely place smaller odds and ends like přísady, jídlo, nápoje, knihy, svitky, etc... and also just a limited number of these items, though that limit is reasonably large. Inventář is divided up in general sections each consisting of small compartments, or slots in which a single předmět can be stored.\n\nObsah\n1\tGeneral\n2\tProzice pro trofeje\n3\tProzice pro příběhové předměty\n4\tBrašna a alchymistický váček\n5\tGeralt\n5.1\tNote\nGeneral\n\nTo access items, open Inventář by left-clicking on the satchel icon, or by pressing I.\n\nTip: Drag and drop Elixíry into quickslots to create shortcuts in the main screen providing quicker access to Elixíry.\n\nProzice pro trofeje\n\nThe hook or trophy slot, where Geralt can keep one trophy head at a time. Nothing else can be kept there.\n\nNote\nIf you happen to have a trophy head on you when you upgrade to Havranova zbroj, that trophy head will fall to the floor and must be retrieved before proceeding.\n\t\nProzice pro příběhové předměty\n\nThe quest items inventory pocket is the part of your Inventář screen which contains a side-scrolling list of all items with the special status of \"příběhový předmět\" during gameplay. You can neither add nor remove items items to or from this section of your Inventář, other than to click on an item to give it to another game character for the purposes of a úkol. This seemingly small section actually contains an unlimited number of slots.\n\n\t\nBrašna a alchymistický váček\n\nThis is all the stuff that Geralt carries. Since the introduction of the Enhanced Edition, the main Inventář has been divided into two sections: brašna a alchymistický váček. Brašna is the main skladiště compartment in Geralt's Inventář. It holds a all the items which can be picked up, excluding zbraně, přísady a příběhové předměty. Alchymistický váček holds all rostliny, minerály and monster parts, except additional goods. Prior to the Enhanced Edition, alchemical přísady were kept in brašna and there was no separate alchymistický váček. An image of that Inventář can be found here.\n\nBrašna is now divided into three sub-compartments (there were four), each has 14 slots, for a total of 42 slots. There is also a sort button to the left now to sort like items. This may or may not be helpful to you depending on how you like the sort. (For the record, I do not). It holds:\n\nAlkohol\nBrousky a runové kameny\nKnihy a svitky\nPetardy, and bomb-making supplies (non-alchemical)\nJídlo a Nápoje\nDárky\nOleje\nElixíry\nso-called \"cenná ingredience\", monster parts that cannot be used in alchemy\na other miscellaneous items like Křesadlo\n\nAlchymistický váček has another three compartments the same size as the satchel, making for a further 42 slots. It also has a sort button and a very handy basic substance identifying button. It holds:\n\nRostliny\nMinerály\nKategorie:Živočišné přísady, more commonly known as monster parts\na Speciální ingredience, unique monster parts, sometimes called mutagens.\n\nThe new management system for the alchemical přísady is a vast improvement over the previous Inventář panel. Depending on your habits, it could take a bit of getting used to, but it works very well and greatly simplifies finding přísady you need. Overall, compared to the original Inventář, there are now an additional 28 slots for general Inventář, a 50% improvement.\n\nIndividual items may or may not stack. For example, prsteny do not stack, but náhrdelníky a přísady do. The maximum number of items in a stack varies.\n\n50 - Rostliny, živočišné přísady (except non-alchemical skinnable items) a minerály\n10 - Jídlo a nápoje, non-alchemical skinnable items\n\nThere are also other reasons why some items will not stack. One example is elixíry. Elixíry with a secondary ingredient as dominant substance will not stack with similar elixíry lacking the dominant substance (simply put, some elixíry refuse to stack and this is why). In fact, some water won't stack with other water ... I wonder ...\n\n[This particular visual example is a shot of my own Inventář, somewhere in Act II. Some of my organizational obsession is evident (if you look closely) but it's just not as ordered as I like it!

For instance, his swords are strapped to his back, daggers are in a thigh-holster, and so forth.\n\n\t\n2× Prozice pro meče:\nOcelový meč (right sword slot)\nStříbrný meč (left sword slot)\nProzice pro Zbroje (over main torso)\nProzice pro těžké zbraně (over left boot)\nProzice pro krátké zbraně (next to right boot), which can also hold a second steel sword\n2× Prozice pro prsten (at the end of each hand)\n1 – 3× Quickslots (to the right of his head)\nfor Elixíry a / nebo Petardy\n\t\nNote\nVyztužená koženice has only one quickslot, and Havranova zbroj has three. For most of the game, Geralt uses Mistrovská koženice which has two quickslots. This can cause some small amount of aggravation when switching to Havranova zbroj, if you fail to empty your quickslot before the trade. It's not catastrophic, just remember to pick up what fell on the floor.\nHavranova zbroj provides an extra short weapon slot. see also: Zbroje"
