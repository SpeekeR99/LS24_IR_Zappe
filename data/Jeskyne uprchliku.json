        "The fighting between the Řád planoucí růže and the Scoia'tael in the streets of Stará Wyzima has taken its toll and former residents are now refugees, seeking shelter anywhere. Their daily battles in the streets have driven many Vizimans into the Hřbitov v bažinách. At least there they need only fear the topivec, utopencis and bloedzuigers.\n\nScattered about the swamp are a number of caves. Some caves lead to ancient and abandoned crypts, others to long forgotten industrial concerns. Three of the caves have now become known as Jeskyně uprchlíků, for obvious reasons:\n\nObsah\n1\tDruidská jeskyně\n2\tVýchodní jeskyně\n3\tJižní jeskyně\n4\tMapa\nDruidská jeskyně\n\nThe Druids' cave tends to be the first cave Geralt finds in the Swamp Cemetery. Just west and north of Ostrov s kryptou strigy, it is where he must lead either Shani or Zoltan, depending on volba strany he has chosen. It is also where Bratránek Corbin is hiding along with some Druids preparing for Zelený pochod\n\n Houby can be found here\n\n\n\n\nVýchodní jeskyně\n\nThe second (for lack of a better designation) cave entrance can be found near the entrance to the Cemetery, just east of Ostrov s kryptou strigy. Basically, there is nothing there except one of Antoinette's bratranci, Buse. There may be some loot in a barrel, but otherwise, this cave is a big disappointment.\n\n Houby can be found here\n\n\n\n\nJižní jeskyně\n\nThis is the most southerly of the three refugee caves, and so tends to be the last of the Refugee caves that Geralt finds. It is south and to the ever-so-slightly west of Ostrov s kryptou strigy and has two chambers. One is where Zdeněk, the most famous fist fighter in history resides. Hidden in the recesses of this chamber lies one of the starodávné krypty: Doupě Agnes de Glanville. The other chamber is where Bratránek Ramerot and another refugee are holed up.\n\n Houby can be found here\n\n\n\n\nMapa\n\nThis map shows the locations of the three caves relative to the entrance to the Hřbitov v bažinách:\n\nMapa do Jeskyně uprchlíků"
