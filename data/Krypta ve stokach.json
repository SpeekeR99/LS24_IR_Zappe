        "Krypta ve stokách is (as the name quite obviously suggests) a crypt in the Wyzimské stoky which is behind a locked gate. Geralt is given the key to these gates by the rascal who hangs out by the sewer entrance every morning between 06:00 and 09:00.\n\nInside is a fairly standard crypt, guarded graveirs and ghúls, about a half dozen of each. There is also a nicely stocked chest in the deepest, darkest chamber, along with a ohniště and a corpse.\n\nÚkoly\nPoklad\nMapa\nMapa"
