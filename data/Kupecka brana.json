        "Kupecká brána is where Geralt first encounters Mikul, one of the Podhradí' most prominent citizens, at least according to the Velebný pán. The Merchants' Bridge leading up to it is also the scene of a Salamandra ambush involving Kalkstein.\n\nThese gates remained locked for the duration of the game. Although Geralt does see both sides of them, he never actually passes through them.\n\nÚkoly\nKrypta\nLidé a nestvůry\nPokerové kostky: nováček"
