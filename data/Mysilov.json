        "Myšilov in the TV series, played by Aleksander Bednarz\n\nMyšilov (Polish: Myszowór) is a skilled and intelligent druid, and also a good friend and advisor to King Bran of Skellige, as well as of Queen Callanthé of Cintra. He has a thickset and robust appearance and wears a bushy beard.\n\nObsah\n1\tVystupuje v povídkách\n2\tV komiksu\n3\tV Zaklínač (film i seriál)\n3.1\tEpizody\n4\tVe hře Zaklínač\nVystupuje v povídkách\n\n\"Otázka ceny\", \"Meč osudu\", \"Něco víc\" a \"Něco končí, něco začíná\" (non-canon).\n\nV komiksu\n\nMyšilov as a young boy in \"Droga bez powrotu\"\n\nMyšilov byl syn Manissy , čarodějky ve službách Fregenala ,který byl zabit v sebeobraně Korinem (budoucím Geraltovým otcem). Myšilovův otec opustil Manissu, když byl Myšilov malým chlapcem. Not knowing that the warrior killed his mother, the young Myšilov befriended Korin and the druid Visenna, who took him to the druid circle of Mayena (\"Droga bez powrotu\").\n\nMyšilov as a young druid in \"Zdrada\"\n\nEven though, due to the plots of mágové and the king, the Mayena Circle was destroyed, Myšilov and two older druids were invited by the king to a witcher tournament which was to take place on a special arena. When the tournament turned into a massacre of witchers of the Wolf School, Myšilov helped Geralt, his childhood friend, escape (\"Zdrada\").\n\nMyšilov was opposed to the arguments of Eltibald and Stregobor during a council of wizards in which he took part, when they argued to consider the children born in the year of černého slunce monsters (\"Menší zlo\").\n\nEven though Myšilov appears in three out of six graphic novels by Maciej Parowski and Bogusław Polch, none of them was actually based on a short story in which he appeared (two of them were based on other short stories, while one was a story original to the comic). In his graphic novel appearances, he is younger than in the short stories he features in, and does not yet have his beard. No ties with Skellige are also mentioned, although it is possible that he moved to Skellige after the destruction of the Mayena Circle.\n\nV Zaklínač (film i seriál)\n\nIn the series, Myšilov appears in the episodes \"Callanthé\" and \"Rozcestí\", played by actor Aleksander Bednarz.\n\nEpizody\n01 Začátek Konce\n03 Zrádce měsíc\n04 O hostinách, parchantech a pohřbech\n06: Callanthé\n08: Rozcestí\nVe hře Zaklínač\n\nVe hře se Myšilov nebojeví, ovšem je ale zmíněn Hierofantem v Druidském hájku v Kapitole III. Hierofant poví Geraltovi že ho zná díky svému parťákovi ve hře v kostky, jejich \"společnému příteli, Myšilovovi.\""
