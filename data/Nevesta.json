        "Nevěsta - Two bad things can happen to a girl on her wedding day: a runaway bridegroom or transformation into a polednice. The latter seems to be worse, as it limits the list of wedding gifts to those people who enter the fields at high noon. They become easy prey for this přelud who wears a wedding garland on her head.\n\nÚkoly\nV poledním žáru\nGalerie\nNevěsta z Deník"
