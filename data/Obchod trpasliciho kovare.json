        "Obchod trpasličího kováře v \"Malém Mahakamu\", nelidské čtvti ve Wyzimské Chrámové čtvrti, is run by Malcolm Stein, the blacksmith and his apprentice, the trader. They will serve only people who come recommended, and will not have their weapons be used against nelidé. How can you tell if he'll deal with you?\n\nThis is one of the only places you can get a bleskosvod made. Zbrojíř Řádu wouldn't know one if he tripped over it and was subsequently struck by lightning. You can also buy and sell goods here:\n\nZbraně\nZbroje\nBrousky a runové kameny\nMeteority\n\nThis should not be confused with the dům trpasličího kováře located just east of here. Despite the fact that the mouse-over text on the door does say \"house\" not \"shop\", narratively, it is the shop.\n\nÚkoly\nNoční hosté (z Kapitoly I)\nPodezřelý: Vivaldi\nPrůzkum bojem\nStrážce\nStrašidelný dům\nPersonál\n\t"
