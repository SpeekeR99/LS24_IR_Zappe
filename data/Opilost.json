        "Ve hře Zaklínač, intoxication is one of the more unique and fun aspects. Basically you can get Geralt \"wasted out of his gourd\", either deliberately or by accident. What ensues is the fun part. You see the world as a very drunken witcher would, i.e. everything is double or triple and swimming before your eyes. In the isometric view, you get quite a funny little animation of Geralt stumbling around trying to get from one place to another, bumping into stuff and forgetting where he was going along the way.

So there are remedies to being drunk:\n\nthe time-honoured sleeping it off. Depending on how drunk Geralt is, this can take several hours\nŽenské slzy\nit's possible that the Rituálu Očištění also works\n\nna zdraví!"
