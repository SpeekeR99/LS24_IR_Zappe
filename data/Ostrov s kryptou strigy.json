        "Ostrov s kryptou strigy rules the scenery of the Hřbitov v bažinách, rising high above its surroundings, visible from every point. Even though the bridge that once led to the island from Staré hradiště has crumbled almost beyond repair, the island is far from unreachable. Thus, a few refugees from Stará Wyzima have set up a ohniště there, preferring the many threats that populate the abandoned burial grounds: the utopencis and the topivec, the bloedzuigers and the bruxae and the garkains. And, above all, the striga, who retreats into her krypta for the day.\n\nThere's a Kruh živlů, Kruh tichého hromu on the island, too."
