        "Pohřebiště golemů is in the north central part of the Bažiny. Notably, there are several stone golems, frozen in position scattered about the place and three very interesting posts that appear to call forth lightning when touched. One of the golems is not buried and much closer to these posts than the rest.\n\nÚkoly\nPrůzkum bojem\nStrážce\nTajemná věž\nObelisky\nBílý tesák, indirectly"
