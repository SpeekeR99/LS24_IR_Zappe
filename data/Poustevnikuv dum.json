        "Poustevníkův dům is part of a little fenced compound in the southern part of the pole outside Bahnice. Inside the enclosure are actually two huts: the Poustevník's own abode and a second hut. Initially this second hut is locked but the witcher can choose it as one of three possible rewards for completing a quest for the druid. There are also a couple of little utility buildings (locked as well) and a campfire. Finally, the compound is also the final resting place of knights who have fallen in service to Paní jezera.\n\nÚkoly\nPronásledování Divokého honu"
