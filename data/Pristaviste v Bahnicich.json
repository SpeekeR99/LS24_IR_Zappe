        "Přístaviště v Bahnicích is particularly aptly named as it is literally where Geralt lands when he falls out of a portal in the sky, arriving in the sleepy enclave. Triss Ranuncul teleports him there, snatching him from the jaws of death - well perhaps arbalesters of death would be more accurate - at the end of Kapitola III and he is seen \"dropping in\" by odhodlaná dívka who is watching Podvodní města appear that same evening.\n\nNearby stand Chata krále Rybáře and the Oltář Paní jezera. It is also here that the witcher meets Bílá Rayla at the end of Kapitola IV.\n\nÚkoly\nSvobodní elfové\nZvyk je železná košile"
