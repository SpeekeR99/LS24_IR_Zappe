        "Reim is svobodní elfové, born in Modré hory. He fought in Dol Blathanna against humans. V „ceně neutrality”, He is a great scout and tracker, and it is thanks to his skills that Sabrina Glevissig and Merwin Ademeyn with their retinue have reached the údolí Kaer Morhen.\n\nHe can be found wandering around the vicinity of tábor, but not usually within its confines. He seems to prefer lurking in the shadows."
