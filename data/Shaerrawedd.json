        "Error: soubor není platný nebo neexistuje\n\nShaerrawedd is a ruined elven palace — elves didn't build castles — which lies in the forests of Kaedwen. The elves themselves destroyed it after their second clash with humans to prevent them from building a city on the foundations as they had with so many other města. At its heart is a rose bush covered with beautiful white-lilied flowers. Drops of silver glisten on the petals. They were Aelirenn's flowers, and she was known as the White Rose of Shaerrawedd.\n\nPoznámky\nThe name is likely a nod to the famous Sherwood Forest; the name formed of Old English elements scir (bright, clear, shire) and wudu (wood), and thus being \"bright forest\". Whether Shaerrawedd is Starší mluva and could be similarly translated remains unsolved."
