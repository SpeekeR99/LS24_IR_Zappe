        "Tábor nelidí se nachází severovýchodní části bažiny, nedaleko Mágovy věži. Zde Yaevinn a jeho skupina Scoia'tael připravují útok na Řád planoucí růže v úkolu Průzkum bojem.\n\nA haughty Scoia'tael dressed as a huntress in the camp asks Geralt if he knows about Feainnewedd, a golden opportunity for Geralt to give her a dressing down for her bigotry ... or not. He can also ask her about it, not that she'll tell him, but she does give him Lařin dar. If Geralt talks to her again, he can choose to give her the flower, and gets a response that seems to be a dropped plot/translation bug. She will mention \"burmarigold\", which does not exist in the game and does not result in any journal entries. Strangely, the same conversation can be repeated after resting or leaving and returning to the swamp, and if Geralt chooses the same responses (give her flower, etc), she will tell you about \"Green Mould\", which also doesn't seem to result in journal entries.\n\nV Kapitola III, the elves have moved on and the camp, now known as the Tábor Salamandry, has been taken over by Roland Bleinheim and his band of Salamandra. They are coordinating the fisstech operation with his brother, Gellert, back in the city. They deal with the gathering of Květ dvouzubce, a primary ingredient and he runs the Úkryt Salamandry na stokách.\n\nÚkoly\nDiplomacie a lov\nPrůzkum bojem\nRostliny\nKvět dvouzubce\nFeainnewedd"
