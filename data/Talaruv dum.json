        "Talarův dům is on Heroes on the Guard Street, facing the back entrance to Lebedův lazaret garden and just around the corner from the City Vězení.\n\nPoznámky\nGeralt can sleep here for free in Kapitola II\nTalarův dům remains accessible in Kapitola III, but Talar himself is no longer there, having apparently moved. The place looks deserted and so Geralt can no longer use it as a place to meditate.]"
