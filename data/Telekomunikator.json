        "There are three telekomunikátor depicted over the course of the game. Triss Ranuncul mentions that they can only be used to communicate over short distances. The three found in the game are: Triss' mirror, Hartmann's mirror and Azar Javed's mirror.\n\nObsah\n1\tTriss' mirror\n2\tHartmann's mirror\n3\tJaved's mirror\n4\tPoznámky\n5\tGalerie\nTriss' mirror\n\nTriss' mirror is found v Akt III, in the bedroom of her home in the Kupecká čtvrť. As Geralt regains consciousness in the opening scene, Triss can be seen using her mirror to speak with another sorceress, possibly Filippa Eilhart. This mirror is also a teleport.\n\nHartmann's mirror\n\nHartmann's mirror is found at the Úkryt Salamandry in the restricted area of Kupecká čtvrť. The mirror is featured in a cut scene as part of the Zámek a klíč quest. It is only seen during one part of Akt III and Geralt uses it on that one occasion to speak with Radovid (unless he forgets to do so...)\n\nJaved's mirror\n\nGeralt finds one last telecommunicator, Javed's mirror in the mage's laboratory in the katakomby of the Old Manor in Act V. It is through the discovery of this telekomunikátor that Geralt learns who is truly behind the Salamandra organization.\n\nPoznámky\n\nIt has been mentioned in Sága o Zaklínači that \"Hartmann's mirror\" may serve as a gateway to other worlds - both ways.\n\nGalerie\nTriss' mirror\nHartmann's mirror\nAzar Javed's mirror"
