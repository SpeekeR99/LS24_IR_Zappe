He has two daughters, Alina, the bride to be, and Celina, her jealous younger sister, and is looking forward to having Julián, a rich merchant from Kovir, as his son-in-law. He considers Adam, whom he knows to be infatuated with his daughter, to be a fool.\n\nHe has a fairly peculiar manner of speaking and seems to like choosing nicknames for people. He continually refers to the witcher as \"Beastie baiter\", how colorful... His other hobbies include kostky. He is a professional level player.\n\nDuring the day, he can be found at his house, or rather one of this houses, if the hostinský is to be believed. He is usually inside, but occasionally goes outside for a breath of fresh air. When asked about witcher work, he mentions that he will pay for the heads of Teyu and Ureus, monsters currently plaguing the peaceful surroundings.\n\nÚkoly\nPokerové kostky: profesionál, as a possible opponent\nZatopené město\nLetitý nekrofág\nV poledním žáru, very indirectly\nKněz rybolidí"
