        "Varování - Spoiler : Následují zásadní informace o ději, které mohou prozradit příběhové zápletky.\n\nÚkryt Salamandry in the Podhradí of Wyzima is in one of the two most southerly abandoned huts, on the south road which leads to the Kruh větrného tuláka and the cave where Abigail makes her potentially last stand.\n\nThe house is locked until Velebný pán reveals the location of the hideout to Geralt. The Reverend tells him that hostinský Olaf has a key, and indeed he does, but actually the key is not required to enter the hideout, only dispatching the two Salamandra lackeys who guard the place is necessary. However, it is clear that plot-wise, Geralt should go to the hostinec first and rescue Shani and then take the key from Olaf's dead body.\n\nBarghestové have a tendency to show up around this house during the night, Bestie appears occasionally, as does a ghúl from time to time.\n\nÚkoly\nLidé a nestvůry\nSalamandří ocas\nPoznámky\nIf you proceed directly to Úkryt Salamandry without rescuing Shani first, you can dispatch the two lackeys guarding the hideout and then enter the hut without the key. This launches the second, more pitched battle, but then the trapdoor remains locked, so you are indeed forced to go rescue Shani first.\nKonec spoileru."
