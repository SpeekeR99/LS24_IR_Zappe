        "Vesnice cihlářů is barely a hamlet. The handful of huts huddled together around the remains of the Old Road in the southeastern part of the bažiny, just north of přístaviště aren't much to look at. Cihláři go about their daily routine, worshipping Vodní páni and making bricks in the hliniště southwest of the village. They do their best to avoid the many hazards of bažiny: the utopenců, topivců, bloedzuigerů and echinopsů. Sometimes kikimorí even dare enter the village, though those usually shy away from human civilization.\n\nVasčina chýše is the center of the village, housing a shrine to Vodní páni as well as being her place of residence.\n\nIn the area immediately adjacent to the village, there are also two mysterious, ancient obelisks, assigned to Neh'tza and Maal'kad.\n\nDůležité postavy\nVaska, vesnická starší\nStarší cihlář, který toho hodně ví o bažinách. Alas, a brick fell on his head when he was six, and he was never the same.\nOne of the women in village will tell Geralt about květ dvouzubce, kozí pysk and vraní oko in exchange for honey, a shawl, or 50 orénů.\nPoznámky\n\nAfter the Čas sklizně quest (but possibly anytime after the beginning of Kapitola III), Geralt can find some interesting information from some of cihláři. One of cihláři praying inside Vaska's house mentions that \"scouts from the Řádů\" have been asking questions about the witcher's activities and intentions, specifically when it comes to dealing with nelidé.\n\nAnother cihlář tells the witcher that Salamandra have been asking about him as well, even going so far as to try to torture the information out of the villagers. These villagers may be simple folk, but they are extremely principled in their customs. Not one of them succumbs to torture or gives away information about the witcher."
