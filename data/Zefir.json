        "Zefír is a named topivec haunting the waters of břeh a bahnice. According to Najáda, Zefír was \"once one of Wyzima's most famous thieves\" in life. However, on his last escape attempt through the stoky, his loot proved so heavy and his greed so great that he drowned trying to keep it all, but his habits survived death. Somehow, he ended up at the břeh (I suppose the sewers must empty somewhere ... but beautiful jezera Wyzima?), and became the leader of utopence there.\n\nHis theft of náhrdelník s tyrkysem is behind the Najáda's request, when Geralt first meets her at břeh at the beginning of Kapitola IV.\n\nÚkoly\nZvyk je železná košile\nPoznámky\nDespite being topivec, he drops mozek utopence, and not jazyk topivce."
