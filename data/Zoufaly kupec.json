        "Zoufalé obchodník can be found wandering up and down hráz in Kapitola III. It seems that he is in need of the services of a witcher to retrieve a Rodový prsten lost in bažiny. Apparently his relative was attacked by monsters near Svatyně Melitelé and when he tried to run away he only fled farther into swamp and the path of danger. Needless to say, he perished and with him, somewhere v bažinách is a valuable ring.\n\nÚkoly\nPrsten"
